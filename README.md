This is a python package that contains different algorithm proposed in different research papers in order to perform EMG classification
The Algorithms currently implemented for classification of EMG are:
1. Classification of EMG signals using PSO optimized SVM for diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.01.020)
2. IDENTIFYING THE MOTOR NEURON DISEASE IN EMG SIGNAL USING TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN FEATURES WITH COMPARISON (DOI: 10.5121/sipij.2012.3207)
